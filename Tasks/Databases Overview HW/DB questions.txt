1.What database models do you know?

	Hierarchical, Network, Entity-relationship, Relational

2.Which are the main functions performed by a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)?

	View data that meet certain criteria.
	Create a new table that is a subset of a base table.
	Connect the contents of two different tables.
	Combine data in two tables.
	View data that have no relationship.
	Add new data to existing records.
	Delete data from existing records.

3.Define what is "table" in database terms.

	A group of rows that match the parameters set up for the table. 
		The data in a table must all be related.

4.Explain the difference between a primary and a foreign key.

	Primary key is the unique identifier of a row in a table.
	On the other hand foreign key is a unique identifier of a row in another table.

5.Explain the different kinds of relationships between tables in relational databases.

	-One-to-one : One row in one table is connected to only one row in another table.
	-One-to-many : One row in one table is connected to zero,
		 one and more than one rows in another table.
	-Many-to-many : Zero, one or many rows in one table are linked to zero,
		 one ot many rows in another table.

6.When is a certain database schema normalized?

	Database is normalized when:
	- is eliminating redundant data
	- data is logically stored

	- First Normal Form
		- every column should be single valued
		- in each column the values stored must be of the same type
		- each column should have a unique name
		- order in which we store the data doesn't matter

	- Second Normal Form
		- any attribute in the table should depends on the complete primary key

	- Third Normal Form
		- Non-prime atribute should not depends on other non-prime attributes.

	-Boyce-Codd Normal Form
		- Non-prime atribute should not depends prime attributes.

	-Forth Normal Form
		- the table should not have any Multi-valued Dependency.

	
7.What are the advantages of normalized databases?
	
	-Normalization produces smaller tables with smaller rows
	-Searching, sorting, and creating indexes is faster
	-More tables allow better use of segments to control physical placement of data.
	-You usually have fewer indexes per table, so data modification commands are faster.
	-Fewer null values and less redundant data, making your database more compact.

8.What are database integrity constraints and when are they used?

	-Domain contraints
		-Domain constraints can be defined as the definition of a 
			valid set of values for an attribute.

	-Entity integrity constraints
		-The entity integrity constraint states that primary key value can't be null.
		
	-Referential Integrity Constraints
		-In the Referential integrity constraints, if a foreign key in Table 1 
			refers to the Primary Key of Table 2, 
			then every value of the Foreign Key in Table 1 must be null 
			or be available in Table 2.

	-Key constraints
		-An entity set can have multiple keys, but out of which one key will be the primary key.
			A primary key must contain a unique value.

9.Point out the pros and cons of using indexes in a database.


10.What's the main purpose of the SQL language?


11.What are transactions used for?


12.Give an example.


13.What is a NoSQL database?


14.Explain the classical non-relational data models.


15.Give few examples of NoSQL databases and their pros and cons.
